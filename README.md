**Scientific Computing Class - Homework Repository**

Welcome to the Scientific Computing Class Homework Repository! This repository contains assignments, projects, and additional materials for my coursework in scientific computing.

ðŸ“š Course Overview

This repository contains my assignments and projects from a survey of numerical techniques for differential equations. The course focuses on implementing numerical schemes to solve application problems in science and engineering. Key topics include:


Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):
Initial Value Problems
Second-Order Boundary Value Problems
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):
Finite Difference Methods
Finite Element Methods
Spectral Methods
Programming is an integral part of this course, and I utilize [Python/MATLAB] for implementing the numerical methods.
